 ```python3
from .models import Data
 ```

# Register your models here.
 ```python3
class DataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'worked_fields', 'academic_fields', 'worked_industry', 'invested_time', 'predictions')
admin.site.register(Data, DataAdmin)
 ```

###### It looks like you're starting to define a Django admin class named DataAdmin by subclassing admin.ModelAdmin. In Django, the admin classes are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the admin interface for your models.

 ```python3
class DataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
 ```
###### list_display: Specifies the fields that will be displayed in the list view of the admin interface for the Data model.
###### list_filter: Adds a filter option in the right sidebar of the admin list view, allowing you to filter data based on the selected field.
###### search_fields: Enables a search bar in the admin interface, allowing you to search for data based on the specified fields.
###### admin.site.register(Data, DataAdmin): Registers the Data model with the DataAdmin class, linking your custom admin configuration to the model.

###### You can further customize the DataAdmin class by adding more attributes and methods as needed based on how you want to present and manage your data in the admin interface.
###### Keep in mind that the specific attributes and methods you need to define in DataAdmin will depend on the fields and behavior of your Data model and how you want to interact with it in the admin interface.

 ```python3
    list_display = ('name', 'worked_fields', 'academic_fields', 'worked_industry', 'invested_time', 'predictions')
 ```
###### It looks like you've used the admin.site.register(Data, DataAdmin) line, which registers the Data model with the DataAdmin class you defined. This line is a crucial step in connecting your custom admin configuration with the specific model, allowing you to manage and display instances of the Data model using the customized admin interface defined in the DataAdmin class.

###### admin.site: This refers to the global instance of the Django admin site. You access this instance to register models and configure their corresponding admin classes.

###### register(Data, DataAdmin): The register method of the admin site is used to associate a model with its corresponding admin class. In your case, you're associating the Data model with the DataAdmin class, meaning that the admin interface for the Data model will follow the customizations and settings defined in DataAdmin.

###### This line essentially tells Django's admin system to use the DataAdmin class to manage instances of the Data model within the admin interface. This way, when you access the admin interface for your Django project and navigate to the section related to the Data model, you'll see the customizations and configurations you've defined in the DataAdmin class. This can include how the data is displayed, filtered, searched, and more.

 ```python3
admin.site.register(Data, DataAdmin)
 ```
