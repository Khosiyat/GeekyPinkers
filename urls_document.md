 ```python3
from django.urls import path
from .import views 
 ```

###### The line from django.urls import path is importing the path function from the django.urls module. This function is commonly used in Django projects to define URL patterns for your web application.

###### The path function is used to associate a URL pattern with a specific view function. It's a key part of how Django handles routing and navigation within your application. Here's a simple example of how the path function is typically used in your urls.py file:

###### In this example, path('', views.home, name='home') associates an empty URL (root URL) with the home view function. Similarly, path('about/', views.about, name='about') associates the /about/ URL with the about view function. The name argument provides a unique identifier for the URL pattern, which can be used to reference it in templates and other parts of your code.

###### These URL patterns define how different parts of your web application respond to incoming requests. When a user navigates to a specific URL, Django uses the URL patterns to determine which view function should be called to handle that request.

###### Remember to replace 'home', 'about', and other view function names with the actual names of your views. The path function is an essential component of Django's URL routing system, allowing you to create a coherent navigation structure for your web application.

 ```python3
from django.urls import path
 ```
###### In this statement, you're importing the views module from the same package or directory as the current script. This is a common practice in Django projects, where you define views in the views.py module and then import them into other parts of your app, such as URLs, other views, or other modules.

###### Once you've imported the views module, you can access the functions or classes defined in that module using the views namespace. For example, you might have a view function named my_view defined in the views module:

 ```python3
from .import views 
 ```

 ```python3
urlpatterns=[
    path('', views.index, name='dashboard-index'),
    path('predictions/', views.predictions, name='dashboard-predictions' )
]
 ```

###### In Django, the urlpatterns list is used to define the URL patterns for your application. These patterns determine how the URLs are matched and which view functions or classes should be executed when a specific URL is accessed. 
 ```python3
urlpatterns=[ ]
 ```

###### 1) path(''): The first argument of the path function is the URL pattern to match. In this case, the empty string '' represents the root path of your application (i.e., the main homepage).

###### 2) views.index: The second argument is the view function or class that should be executed when this URL pattern is accessed. In this case, views.index refers to the index view function defined in the views module.

###### 3) name='dashboard-index': The name parameter assigns a name to this URL pattern. Naming URL patterns is useful for reverse URL matching, where you can refer to URLs by their names instead of their actual paths. In this case, the name 'dashboard-index' is assigned to this URL pattern.
 ```python3
    path('', views.index, name='dashboard-index'),
 ```

###### 1) path('predictions/'): The first argument of the path function is the URL pattern to match. In this case, 'predictions/' represents the path that follows the base URL of your application. When a user accesses this path (e.g., http://yourdomain.com/predictions/), the associated view function or class will be executed.

###### 2) views.predictions: The second argument is the view function or class that should be executed when this URL pattern is accessed. In this case, views.predictions refers to the predictions view function defined in the views module.

###### 3) name='dashboard-predictions': The name parameter assigns a name to this URL pattern. This name is used for reverse URL matching, allowing you to refer to URLs by their names rather than their actual paths. In this case, the name 'dashboard-predictions' is assigned to this URL pattern.
 ```python3
    path('predictions/', views.predictions, name='dashboard-predictions' )
 ```
